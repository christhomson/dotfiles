# Stolen from https://gist.github.com/skanev/9d4bec97d5a6825eaaf6.
# A sneaky wrapper around Rubocop that allows you to run it only against
# the recent changes, as opposed to the whole project. It lets you
# enforce the style guide for new/modified code only, as opposed to
# having to restyle everything or adding cops incrementally. It relies
# on git to figure out which files to check.
#
# Here are some options you can pass in addition to the ones in rubocop:
#
#   --local               Check only the changes you are about to push
#                         to the remote repository.
#
#   --uncommitted         Check only changes in files that have not been
#   --index               committed (i.e. either in working directory or
#                         staged).
#
#   --against REFSPEC     Check changes since REFSPEC. This can be
#                         anything that git will recognize.
#
#   --branch              Check only changes in the current branch.
#
#   --courage             Without this option, only the modified lines
#                         are inspected. When supplied, it will check
#                         the full contents of the file. You should have
#                         the courage to fix your style violations as
#                         you see them, you know.
#
# Caveat emptor:
#
# * Monkey patching ahead. This script relies on Rubocop internals and
#   has been tested against 0.25.0. Newer (or older) versions might
#   break it.
#
# * While it does try to check modified lines only, there might be some
#   quirks. It might not show offenses in modified code if they are
#   reported at unmodified lines. It might also show offenses in
#   unmodified code if they are reported in modified lines.
